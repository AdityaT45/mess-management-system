# ✅ Login API Integration - Fixed!

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Network Connection Issue**
- **Problem**: Using `localhost:8080` which doesn't work in React Native
- **Solution**: Updated to use your computer's IP address: `192.168.1.33:8080`

### 2. **API Response Format**
- **Problem**: Your API returns a different format than expected
- **Solution**: Updated authentication service to handle your response format:

```json
{
    "bearer token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
    "role": [{"authority": "ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN"}],
    "username": "super@gmail.com"
}
```

### 3. **Token Storage Issue**
- **Problem**: localStorage doesn't exist in React Native
- **Solution**: Updated to use in-memory token storage

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### Step 1: Make Sure Your API Server is Running
```bash
# Start your backend server on port 8080
# You should see: "Server running on port 8080"
```

### Step 2: Test the Connection
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://192.168.1.33:8080/auth/login
```

### Step 3: Try Login in Your App
- Use the quick login button for: `super@gmail.com / 1234`
- Check the console logs for detailed information

## 📱 **Expected Behavior**

1. **Login Request**: `POST http://192.168.1.33:8080/auth/login`
2. **API Response**: Your JWT token and user data
3. **App Response**: User logged in with role "superadmin"
4. **Navigation**: Redirected to appropriate dashboard

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

The app now logs:
- API request URL and payload
- Raw API response
- Token storage status
- User data extraction

## 🎯 **Your API Response Handling**

The authentication service now correctly:
- Extracts `bearer token` from your response
- Gets `username` from your response
- Extracts role from `role[0].authority`
- Normalizes role to app format (`ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` → `superadmin`)

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check console logs** - Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify API server** - Make sure it's running on port 8080
3. **Test with browser** - Try accessing your API directly
4. **Check network** - Make sure both devices are on same WiFi

The login should now work perfectly! 🎉
